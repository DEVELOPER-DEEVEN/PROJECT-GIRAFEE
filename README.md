# Windows AI Assistant - Vy Competitor

A native Windows AI assistant that enables natural language control of your computer, automating tasks across applications and providing intelligent assistance.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Command your computer in plain English
- **Visual Context Awareness**: AI that can "see" and understand screen content
- **Cross-Application Automation**: Work seamlessly across different Windows apps
- **Workflow Recording**: Teach the AI by demonstrating tasks
- **Background Processing**: Run tasks without interrupting your work
- **Scheduled Automation**: Set up recurring tasks and workflows

### Key Components
- **Screen Capture Engine**: Real-time screen analysis and UI element detection
- **Natural Language Processor**: Converts user commands to executable actions
- **Application Integration Layer**: Interfaces with Windows applications
- **Workflow Engine**: Records, stores, and replays complex multi-step tasks
- **Scheduler**: Manages automated task execution
- **Background Task Manager**: Handles non-intrusive task processing

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd windows-ai-assistant

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Assistant**: Launch the application and grant necessary permissions
2. **Natural Language Commands**: Type commands like "Open Chrome and search for Python tutorials"
3. **Workflow Recording**: Use the record feature to teach complex multi-step tasks
4. **Scheduled Tasks**: Set up automated workflows to run at specific times
5. **Background Processing**: Run tasks without interrupting your current work
